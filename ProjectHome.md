Statistical inference and planning Markov decision processes and algorithms for reinforcement learning. Some highlights include:

Bayesian estimators including:
- Parametric conjugate distributions (e.g. Dirichlet/Multinomial)
- Non-parametric methods (Gaussian processes, various tree models)
- Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
- Various (problem-specific) Monte-Carlo samplers.

(Approximate) dynamic programming algorithms
- Backwards induction / value iteration
- Policy iteration
- Rollout sampling policy iteration
- Least-Squares Policy Iteration
- Least-Squares Temporal Differences
- Fitted Value / Q - iteration.

Reinforcement learning algorithms:

- Stochastic approximators (Q-learning, Sarsa and various generalisations)
- Upper-confidence bound algorihtms (UCB/UCRL)
- Bayesian algorithms (Thompson sampling, Upper/Lower Bayesian Bound algorithms)
- Gradient-based Bellman error minimisation (GBRL)
- Example rl-glue backend

Many reinforcement learning environments

- Discrete
- Continuous
- Partially-Observable
- Games

I addition, there are various inverse reinforcent learning models and algorithms
